JMeter JTL to JUnit test results converter.

This project aims to ease conversion from JMeter JTL format to JUnit-compatible XML. This is due to some continuous 
integration systems (namely Hudson/Jenkins) support only a subset of JTL spec and/or take a very opinionated way of
displaying the results, which makes them unusable if JMeter is used for functional testing.

Currently only these JMeter JTL elements are supported:

* `<sample/>`
* `<httpSample/>`


## How to build it?
In order to build this jar, just run maven without any arguments:

    $ mvn

## How to use it?
    java -jar m2j.jar --input <jmeter.jtl> --output <junit.xml> [--testSuiteName <name of the test suite>] [--filter <true/false>]

If the `<name of the test suite>` argument is not given, it will default to `jmeter`.

Sometimes we want selected jmeter samplers' result to convert to junit
If the `--filter` option is not set to `true`, all the jmeter sample results will be converted to junit result as it is.
If `--filter true`, only those samples will be converted which have `@junit` as part of their name `ie label`
